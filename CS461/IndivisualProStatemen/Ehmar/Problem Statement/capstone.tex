        STEM Academy requires a database system to collect survey data for assessment, in order to determine their impacts on the respective participants.This will allow easy access to information that can be used to apply for funding for continued growth of the program. A Capstone team developed a database last year that doesn't meet all requirements, and isn't fully functional. Our team will review the coding from the previous project, and make necessary changes to improve the database system and hopefully meet all of the requirements. We will also be providing standard reporting and work on graphics, pre-programmed into the system.

\section{Knowledge Required}
- Skills to understand the current database system, and make changes to it to meet the program requirements.\newline
- Be able to work with an employee who isn't tech-savvy and collaborate on a regular basis.
\section{Objectives}
- Communicate with non-computer science employee to comprehend the program requirements and make appropriate design decisions. \newline
- Study the current code of the database and make changes as needed.
- Generate standard reports.
- Resulting database should allow for changes in survey data in the future.
\section{Deliverables}
- A database system that is improved upon from last year, is fully functional and meets all the requirements.
