       STEM Academy is a growing self-funded program who offer quality programming and provide opportunities. They need a database to compile and assess survey data used to determine its impact on participants. It also applies for future funding from different resources. This project will make a long-term impact on children who are going to be the future of science and technology. A database was developed by a capstone team last year, but It did not meet their needs. So this year’s team will be revising the code and making improvements in the database. Our team will have to make changes and implement graphics, reporting in the system.
